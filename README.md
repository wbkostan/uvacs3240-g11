<strong>Description:</strong>
OneDir project is a simple dropbox-like cloud storage and synchronization application.
When active, OneDir monitors the clients local OneDir directory (configured in OneDirClient.py)
and responds to changes in the directory by synchronizing the changes to the backup kept on
a OneDir server (address configurable in OneDirClient.py). Should the client log in from
another computer, the client's entire directory will be synced back from the server.
